# INTRODUCTION

Online shopping is the process whereby the consumers directly buy goods, services, etc. from a
seller interactively in real-time without an intermediary service over the internet. It is buying goods
and services from merchants who sell via the internet.
Today online shopping has become the most efficient way for consumers to obtain their required
goods and for the merchants to sell their goods. The online stores' goods vary from books, clothing,
toys, footwear, to household appliances, hardware, software, pharmaceuticals, etc.
Many people prefer online shopping because of the convenience. For example, when a person
visits a food city to buy groceries, he/she needs to walk throughout the shop, locate the required
goods, and also often needs to stand in long lines to make the purchases. But shopping them online
would get rid of these troubles and would be much more convenient.
It also allows a person to browse through endless possibilities, and even offers merchandise that
would not be available in the local stores. Browsing through different online platforms at the same
time, comparing items, their quality and their rates simultaneously makes shopping easy. The
transactions occur almost immediately, and unlike a store, the online shopping portal is available
24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year.
